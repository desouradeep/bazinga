When the mood strikes, *finding the right movie* is the barrier between going on with life, and actually taking a break and watching a movie.

In the process of finding a movie (which most of the times fail), we watch a previously seen movie, or we do not watch at all.
Most of the time we spend a lot of time on imdb, analysing every movie, until the mood dies.

Now, the mood dies because this work is monotonous. An iteration for every movie. Bots are good at these silly things. This work is not meant for humans.

So, just grab your popcorn, sit back, and let this app, bazinga do an intelligent selection based on stats that we normally care about like imdb rating, duration, plot, genre and every other small things.
